## Description

This repository serves as a learning resource and a collection of practical examples for demonstrating core OOP principles and design patterns in Java. It aims to provide clear and concise implementations to help understand and apply these concepts effectively.

## Concepts Covered

This repository covers the following OOP and OOD concepts:

* **Encapsulation:** Demonstrating how to bundle data and methods within classes.
* **Inheritance:** Showing how to create subclasses that inherit properties and behaviors from superclasses.
* **Polymorphism:** Illustrating method overriding and interface implementation for runtime flexibility.
* **Abstraction:** Using abstract classes and interfaces to define contracts and hide implementation details.
* **Interfaces:** Defining contracts for classes to implement.
* **Method Overriding:** Providing specific implementations for inherited methods.
* **Dynamic Binding/Runtime Polymorphism:** Showing how method calls are resolved at runtime.
